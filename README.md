  - Each time the ball hits a paddle, it changes direction and slightly increases in speed based on the **Speed Delta** setting.
  - Missing the ball results in a point for the opponent and resets the ball's position and speed after a brief pause.
- **Net:** A dotted line runs vertically through the center of the game area, extending from the very top to the bottom, serving as a visual separator.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the game to better suit your preferences:

### Adjusting Starting Speed
- To change the initial speed of the ball, modify the `ball.speed` property in the JavaScript section:
  ```javascript
  var ball = {
      /* ... existing properties ... */
      speed: 5, // Change this value to increase or decrease starting speed
      dx: 5 * (Math.random() > 0.5 ? 1 : -1),
      dy: 5 * (Math.random() > 0.5 ? 1 : -1),
      /* ... existing properties ... */
  };
  ```
  
### Changing Fonts
- The game uses **Times New Roman** by default. To change the font, update the `font-family` properties in the CSS:
  ```css
  body {
      font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
  }
  ```

### Enhancing Visuals
- Modify the `box-shadow` properties in the CSS to adjust the neomorphic effects for different UI elements.
